Final Project, Data Structures and Algorithms

Who? Any scholar who uses flashcards during academic year.

Why? time efficient, digital(easier to carry wherever)

When? By the end of the semester

What? A software program

How? Using data structures, OOP, written in python

## Overview
It is known that one of the best ways to learn new definitions is through flashcards, but they are not always as efficient as they seem to be. 

Any scholar who was used to make paper based flashcards would use this program in order to economy his time and materials on making digital flashcards. The program will let the user to delete, change any chosen flashcard easily. Also, practice session may be whenever and wherever the user wants in order if the computer is with the user.


## User Problem
Physical cards (Time consuming) while digital ones (Time efficient)

Physical cards (easy to lose one) while digital ones (all information will be written in the memory)

Physical ones (not viable everywhere and at anytime) while digital ones (are always saved in the program)

## User Stories:
User has to choose between adding or learning mode,

1. Adding includes: add a word, then add the respective definition, save the information, ask whether to add another one.

2. Learning by word or by definition.

2.1 By word: Shows randomly a word saved before, user pauses to think about the definition, asks program to show the definition, answers whether he/she was right or wrong. Then, asks another randomly chosen word.

2.2 By definition: Shows a definition, asks for user input, checks whether the given answer is correct or not, shows the results. Then asks another randomly chosen definition.
